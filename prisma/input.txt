# 1. Reset the database
npx prisma migrate reset

# 2. Run the migration
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_leave_tracking

# 3. Generate Prisma Client
npx prisma generate


# 1. Create a new migration that aligns with your current schema
npx prisma migrate dev --name sync_schema --create-only

# 2. Review the generated migration file
# 3. If it looks correct, apply it
npx prisma migrate dev

# 4. Generate Prisma Client
npx prisma generate

Most Likely Solution:
Since you're in development and the drift shows you have all the tables already created, I recommend:

bash
# 1. First, mark the current state as a baseline
npx prisma db push

# 2. Then create a migration that captures the current state
npx prisma migrate dev --name baseline_schema

# 3. Now you can continue with normal migrations
npx prisma generate

Alternative Quick Fix:
If you just want to sync the schema without migrations:

bash
# This will align your database with your Prisma schema
npx prisma db push

# Then continue with migrations
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_leave_tracking


Important Notes:
prisma db push - Directly syncs database with schema (doesn't create migration history)

prisma migrate dev - Creates and applies migrations with history tracking

prisma migrate reset - Drops database and reapplies all migrations (loses data)

For your current situation:
Since you're seeing all tables already exist, it seems like you may have run prisma db push before or manually created tables. The safest approach is:
